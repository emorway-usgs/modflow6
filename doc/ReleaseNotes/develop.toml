description = "Fixed a bug preventing graceful termination of all particles in PRT models. With the PRP package's EXTEND\\_TRACKING option enabled, particles beginning the simulation's final timestep in a stationary cell (an active cell with no flow across any boundary) were not terminated gracefully. Particles in this condition will now terminate with status code 10 (timeout)."

description = "PRT previously reported cell exit events (reason code 1) when a particle was dropped to the water table by the DRY\\_TRACKING\\_METHOD DROP mechanism. A new 'dropped' event and corresponding reason code (6) will now be reported when this occurs."

section = "fixes"
subsection = "model"
description = "Fixed ambiguous reporting of cell and subcell events by PRT on DISV grids. Previously subcell exit events and cell exit events were reported with the same event code (1). Subcell events are a tracking method implementation detail, however. Subcell events (and more generally, events occurring at subgrid scale) are no longer included by default in particle tracking output. The PRT Output Control (OC) package's TRACK\\_EXIT option now applies only to features explicitly defined by the grid discretization. Particle events at sub-grid scale are now opt-in with a new keyword option TRACK\\_SUBFEATURE\\_EXIT."

section = "fixes"
subsection = "model"
description = "Fixed two infinite loop conditions in PRT models. First, cyclic paths were possible in the vicinity of assigned boundary faces. When an internal boundary face was assigned (an IFLOWFACE adjacent to another active cell), the adjacent cells could fail to agree on the flow through their shared face, trapping particles in an infinite loop. Particles now terminate at internal assigned boundary faces for which net boundary flow through the face is out of the cell. Particles continue to terminate at all external assigned boundary faces as before. Second, cyclic paths were possible near the water table with GWF models using the NEWTON option. With Newton, dry cells remain active; a flow model may produce numerically insignificant upwards flow through the top face of a partially saturated cell. With DRY\\_TRACKING\\_METHOD DROP (the default option), a particle in a partially saturated cell could obtain an exit solution through the cell's top face, jump to the dry cell above, then drop back down, and so on. In partially saturated cells, any flow upwards through the top face which is not associated with an assigned boundary is now ignored. This prevents particles from exiting through the top face of partially saturated cells unless the top face is an assigned boundary."

description = "Fixed a memory access exception that can occur when writing convergence information to a CSV file (through the CSV\\_OUTER\\_OUTPUT option in IMS) for a parallel solution."

section = "features"
subsection = "model"
description = "Added an optional new COORDINATE\\_CHECK\\_METHOD option to the PRT model's Particle Release Package, accepting values EAGER (default) or NONE. NONE disables release-time verification that release point coordinates and release point cell IDs match, which can significantly reduce runtime when releasing many particles."

description = "Add DEPENDENT\\_VARIABLE\\_SCALING option to scale the dependent variable and the right-hand side to avoid very large positive or negative values in the GWT and GWE models. Specified outer and inner DVCLOSE values in the model IMS package will be relative closure criteria. This option applies the same scaling approach used in the MT3DMS GCG package."

description = "The Particle Tracking (PRT) Model previously reported cell exit events when a dry particle stranded in a partially saturated cell was dropped to the water table, as occurs with DRY\\_TRACKING\\_METHOD DROP (the default). An event is no longer reported at this time."

section = "features"
subsection = "model"
description = "Added a developer option DEV\\_CYCLE\\_DETECTION\\_WINDOW to the PRT Model's Particle Release (PRP) Package. When enabled, this feature maintains a history of recent cell transitions, the size of which is configurable. If a cycle is detected, the program will terminate with an error. A cycle is identified as a duplicate particle event within a single application of the tracking loop, respective to certain particle and cell properties, e.g., exiting through the same cell face twice. This option defaults to 0, disabling cycle detection by default."

section = "features"
subsection = "solution"
description = "Fixed a bug first included in version 6.4.2 that has changed the convergence check of the numerical solution. In cases where the linear solver failed to converge, or when it did converge but the STRICT option was active and convergence did not occur on the first iteration, the solution was erroneously considered for overall convergence."

description = "Fixed a memory exception that has occurred when running parallel solute transport on Windows without the dispersion package. This has no effect on the simulation results other than causing a premature termination in some cases."

subsection = "parallel"
description = "Fixed the case where a convergence failure of the PETSc linear solver halts the program with an exception (error -5). This particular failure is now handled by continuing with the next outer iteration. This is equivalent to what happens when using the IMS solver in a serial simulation."

subsection = "stress"
description = "Added HIGHEST\\_SATURATED option to the GWT SRC package. When activated, the HIGHEST\\_SATURATED option will apply a mass source loading rate to the specified CELLID or the highest underlying cell with a non-zero cell saturation. The HIGHEST\\_SATURATED option has an additional complication for certain types of grids specified using the DISU Package. When the DISU Package is used, a cell may have more than one cell underlying it. If the overlying cell were to become inactive, there is no straightforward method for determining how to apportion the mass source loading rate to the underlying cells. In this case, the approach described by \\cite{modflowusg} is used. The mass source loading rate is assigned to the first active cell encountered (determined by searching through the underlying cell numbers from the lowest number to the highest number). In this manner, the total mass source loading rate is conserved; however, the spatial distribution of the applied mass source loading rate may not be maintained as layers become dry or wet during a simulation."

section = "features"
subsection = "basic"
description = "Added a coordinate reference system option CRS to discretization packages. For example, an EPSG integer code, authority string, or Open Geospatial Consortium Well-Known Text (WKT) specification. This option does not affect simulation results, but is written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the grid in space. A new binary grid file version number (2) is introduced to indicate that CRS information may be present."
